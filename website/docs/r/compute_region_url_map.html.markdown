## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `default_service` -
  (Required)
  A reference to RegionBackendService resource if none of the hostRules match.

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
  you create the resource.

* `host_rule` -
  (Optional)
  The list of HostRules to use against the URL.  Structure is documented below.

* `path_matcher` -
  (Optional)
  The list of named PathMatchers to use against the URL.  Structure is documented below.

* `test` -
  (Optional)
  The list of expected URL mappings. Requests to update this UrlMap will
  succeed only if all of the test cases pass.  Structure is documented below.

* `region` -
  (Optional)
  The Region in which the url map should reside.
  If it is not provided, the provider region is used.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


The `host_rule` block supports:

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this HostRule. Provide this property
  when you create the resource.

* `hosts` -
  (Required)
  The list of host patterns to match. They must be valid
  hostnames, except * will match any string of ([a-z0-9-.]*). In
  that case, * must be the first character and must be followed in
  the pattern by either - or ..

* `path_matcher` -
  (Required)
  The name of the PathMatcher to use to match the path portion of
  the URL if the hostRule matches the URL's host portion.

The `path_matcher` block supports:

* `default_service` -
  (Required)
  A reference to a RegionBackendService resource. This will be used if
  none of the pathRules defined by this PathMatcher is matched by
  the URL's path portion.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name to which this PathMatcher is referred by the HostRule.

* `path_rule` -
  (Optional)
  The list of path rules. Use this list instead of routeRules when routing based
  on simple path matching is all that's required. The order by which path rules
  are specified does not matter. Matches are always done on the longest-path-first
  basis. For example: a pathRule with a path /a/b/c/* will match before /a/b/*
  irrespective of the order in which those paths appear in this list. Within a
  given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or routeRules must be set.  Structure is documented below.


The `path_rule` block supports:

* `service` -
  (Optional)
  The region backend service resource to which traffic is
  directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is additionally specified,
  advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending
  the request to the backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot
  contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
  weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect,
  service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.

* `paths` -
  (Required)
  The list of path patterns to match. Each must start with / and the only place a
  * is allowed is at the end following a /. The string fed to the path matcher
  does not include any text after the first ? or #, and those chars are not
  allowed here.

* `route_action` -
  (Optional)
  In response to a matching path, the load balancer performs advanced routing
  actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
  request to the selected backend. If routeAction specifies any
  weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely if service is set,
  routeAction cannot contain any  weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction
  or urlRedirect must be set.  Structure is documented below.

* `url_redirect` -
  (Optional)
  When a path pattern is matched, the request is redirected to a URL specified by
  urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or routeAction must not be
  set.  Structure is documented below.


The `route_action` block supports:

* `cors_policy` -
  (Optional)
  The specification for allowing client side cross-origin requests. Please see W3C
  Recommendation for Cross Origin Resource Sharing  Structure is documented below.

* `fault_injection_policy` -
  (Optional)
  The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the
  resiliency of clients to backend service failure. As part of fault injection,
  when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by
  Loadbalancer on a percentage of requests before sending those request to the
  backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the
  Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy will be
  ignored by clients that are configured with a fault_injection_policy.  Structure is documented below.

* `request_mirror_policy` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the route's backends are
  shadowed to a separate mirrored backend service. Loadbalancer does not wait for
  responses from the shadow service. Prior to sending traffic to the shadow
  service, the host / authority header is suffixed with -shadow.  Structure is documented below.

* `retry_policy` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the retry policy associated with this route.  Structure is documented below.

* `timeout` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time
  the request is has been fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream) up until the
  response has been completely processed. Timeout includes all retries. If not
  specified, the default value is 15 seconds.  Structure is documented below.

* `url_rewrite` -
  (Optional)
  The spec to modify the URL of the request, prior to forwarding the request to
  the matched service  Structure is documented below.

* `weighted_backend_services` -
  (Optional)
  A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match
  occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their
  corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend
  service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
  number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
  the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header
  transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this
  HttpRouteAction.  Structure is documented below.


The `cors_policy` block supports:

* `allow_credentials` -
  (Optional)
  In response to a preflight request, setting this to true indicates that the
  actual request can include user credentials. This translates to the Access-
  Control-Allow-Credentials header. Defaults to false.

* `allow_headers` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the content for the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header.

* `allow_methods` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the content for the Access-Control-Allow-Methods header.

* `allow_origin_regexes` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the regualar expression patterns that match allowed origins. For
  regular expression grammar please see en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript
  An origin is allowed if it matches either allow_origins or allow_origin_regex.

* `allow_origins` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the list of origins that will be allowed to do CORS requests. An
  origin is allowed if it matches either allow_origins or allow_origin_regex.

* `disabled` -
  (Required)
  If true, specifies the CORS policy is disabled.

* `expose_headers` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the content for the Access-Control-Expose-Headers header.

* `max_age` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies how long the results of a preflight request can be cached. This
  translates to the content for the Access-Control-Max-Age header.

The `fault_injection_policy` block supports:

* `abort` -
  (Optional)
  The specification for how client requests are aborted as part of fault
  injection.  Structure is documented below.

* `delay` -
  (Optional)
  The specification for how client requests are delayed as part of fault
  injection, before being sent to a backend service.  Structure is documented below.

* `num_retries` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the allowed number retries. This number must be > 0.

* `per_try_timeout` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies a non-zero timeout per retry attempt.  Structure is documented below.

* `retry_conditions` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies one or more conditions when this retry rule applies. Valid values are:
  - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
  any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
  example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
  streams.
  - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
  502, 503 or 504.
  - connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
  connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
  - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
  Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
  - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
  REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
  - cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
  header is set to cancelled
  - deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
  gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
