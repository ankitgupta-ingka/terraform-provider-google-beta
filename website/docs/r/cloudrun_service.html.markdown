# google\_cloudrun\_service

Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of Routes and
Configurations which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a
singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and
which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and
team resource ownership. Service acts only as an orchestrator of the
underlying Routes and Configurations (much as a kubernetes Deployment
orchestrates ReplicaSets).

The Service's controller will track the statuses of its owned Configuration
and Route, reflecting their statuses and conditions as its own.

## Example Usage - Cloudrun Service Basic


```hcl
resource "google_cloudrun_service" "default" {
  name          = "tftest-cloudrun"
  location = "us-central1"
  provider = "google-beta"

  metadata {
    namespace = "my-project-name"
  }

  spec {
    container {
      image = "gcr.io/cloudrun/hello"
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name must be unique within a namespace, within a Cloud Run region.
  Is required when creating
  resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the
  generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended
  for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated.
  More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

* `spec` -
  (Required)
  RevisionSpec holds the desired state of the Revision (from the client).  Structure is documented below.

* `metadata` -
  (Required)
  Metadata associated with this Service, including name, namespace, labels,
  and annotations.  Structure is documented below.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location of the cloud run instance. eg us-central1






The `spec` block supports:

* `timeout_seconds` -
  (Optional)
  TimeoutSeconds holds the max duration the instance is allowed for
  responding to a request.
  Not currently used by Cloud Run.

* `container` -
  (Required)
  Container defines the unit of execution for this Revision.
  In the context of a Revision, we disallow a number of the fields of
  this Container, including: name, ports, and volumeMounts.
  The runtime contract is documented here:
  https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/docs/runtime-contract.md  Structure is documented below.

* `container_concurrency` -
  (Optional)
  ContainerConcurrency specifies the maximum allowed in-flight (concurrent)
  requests per container of the Revision. Values are:
  - `0` thread-safe, the system should manage the max concurrency. This is
     the default value.
  - `1` not-thread-safe. Single concurrency
  - `2-N` thread-safe, max concurrency of N

* `serving_state` -
  ServingState holds a value describing the state the resources
  are in for this Revision.
  Users must not specify this when creating a revision. It is expected
  that the system will manipulate this based on routability and load.
  Populated by the system.
  Read-only.


The `container` block supports:

* `working_dir` -
  (Optional)
  Container's working directory.
  If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which
  might be configured in the container image.
  Cannot be updated.

* `args` -
  (Optional)
  Arguments to the entrypoint.
  The docker image's CMD is used if this is not provided.
  Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's
  environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input
  string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a
  double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded,
  regardless of whether the variable exists or not.
  Cannot be updated.
  More info:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell

* `env_from` -
  (Optional)
  List of sources to populate environment variables in the container.
  The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys
  will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key
  exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will
  take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take
  precedence. Cannot be updated.  Structure is documented below.

* `image` -
  (Required)
  Docker image name.
  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images

* `command` -
  (Optional)
  Entrypoint array. Not executed within a shell.
  The docker image's ENTRYPOINT is used if this is not provided.
  Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's
  environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input
  string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a
  double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded,
  regardless of whether the variable exists or not.
  Cannot be updated.

## Import

Service can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import -provider=google-beta google_cloudrun_service.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/services/{{name}}
$ terraform import -provider=google-beta google_cloudrun_service.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import -provider=google-beta google_cloudrun_service.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.
